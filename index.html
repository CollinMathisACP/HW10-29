<h1>Inner Join</h1>
<p>
Inner Join is an SQL command that allows you to select records from two tables based on a matching value between those tables. 
For example, if a Customers table and an Orders table both have a CustomerID field, then you could select records that have cooresponding 
values for those fields. It is important to note that the INNER command means that the fields must match, like the inner portion of a venn 
diagram.

<h1>What is a Data Scientist</h1>
<p>
A data scientist is someone who manipulates and examines sets of data in order to find useful trends. The context for this work can vary 
based on the specific job, but the core is the same in that statistical algorithms are used to build models that can then be applied 
predictively or just to get a better understanding of a company's operations. A data scientist shares similarities with a computer 
scientist by virtue of the fact that they have to have a solid understanding of their software in order to do their job. However, those 
technical skills are not the main part of their skillset. In fact, one of the videos said that the initial prep work for the data can be 
done by someone else, in order to give the data scientist more time to spend on the deeper statistical work. This is the main difference. A
data scientist works most heavily with statistics.
